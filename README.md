## This a TCP communition project (Python)

Hello! It seems like you are working on a TCP communication project with two different machines in the same network using Python. I have provided a brief description of the server and client side codes.

### Server side:

The server side has two different codes: 
UDP_Server.py and TCP_Server.py. 

- UDP_Server.py is used to send the server IP to the client to establish communication, while TCP_Server.py is used to connect and establish communication with the client to send and receive sockets (continuous communication messages). The order of running these codes does not matter.

The order of running doesn't matter !!!

### Client side:

The client side code has a mix of UDP and TCP.

- Client.py is used to receive the machine’s IP from UDP_Server.py and then make the client communicate with the server’s IP address to establish communication and send messages to the server as input.


### NOTE:

Order of running the scripts doesn't matter you can run in what ever order you please even after an interuption

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.
